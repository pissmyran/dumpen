# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

The public source of dumpen: an image gallery for app icons and themes, on Cloudflare R2, plus its self-hosted Docker image. It is one of four sibling repos (dumpen, jobb, klarsprak, politiker); shared community files, issue forms and the GitHub settings for all of them live in the account's `.github` repo. The code is generic: it contains no account ids, domains, e-mail addresses, keys or other personal values — only `__NAME__` placeholders. Real values live outside the repo and are filled in at deploy (`tools/render.mjs`) or by the user in `docker-compose.yml`. Read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` and `docs/` before larger changes.

| Dir | Entry | Handlers | Bindings |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.` | `src/index.js` (built by `build.mjs`) | fetch | R2 gallery + legacy bucket, Secrets Store |

## The one rule: no personal values

Never write a real id, domain, e-mail address, key, name, donation link or payment detail into code, config, tests, docs or commit messages. Use a placeholder declared in `cloudflare.example.env` (code and config) or `example.com`-style values (docs and tests). Personal assets such as images go in an overlay directory outside the repo. The repo is public.

## Placeholders and deploy

- Every `__NAME__` used in the code must be declared in `cloudflare.example.env`, with an example value and a comment saying where the real value comes from.
- `node tools/render.mjs <values.env | -> <out-dir> [overlay-dir]` copies the repo, fills in every declared placeholder (failing if a value is missing), copies the overlay on top, drops routes with an empty pattern and links `node_modules`. With `-` the values come from environment variables.
- Production is deployed by Workers Builds (Cloudflare's GitHub connection) when a PR is merged to `main`, with the values as Cloudflare build variables: build command `node tools/render.mjs - build`, deploy command `npx wrangler deploy --cwd build`. Only `main` builds; pushing to `dev` deploys nothing.
- A self-hosted deploy from a private values file works the same way: render, then `npx wrangler deploy --cwd build`, and throw the rendered copy away. Secrets go in with `npx wrangler secret put`, never in the repo.
- Deploy the new Worker before applying a migration that drops tables or columns.
- Tests run on the unrendered source, so they see the placeholders.
- Values that encrypt stored data (jobb's `CONFIG_NAMESPACE`) must never change for an existing database.

## Commands

```bash
npm test && npm run check
```

Formatting: Prettier with `.prettierrc.json` (printWidth 100). Run `npx prettier --write <paths>` after editing; CI runs `prettier --check .`. Tests that read source files must not depend on formatting; prefer importing and calling real code over matching source text.

## Architecture

- **dumpen**: an image gallery on R2 with an optional legacy bucket to import from. `src/index.js` targets Workers Static Assets; the deployed script is the self-contained `dist/worker.js` that `build.mjs` builds with `public/` embedded. R2 scans are incremental (metadata at write time, edge cache, one range read per object version). Only `/bilder/*` is public; everything else needs the Access JWT, or a password session with `AUTH_MODE=password` (self-hosting).

## Cost and logging

Target the Workers Free plan: 10 ms CPU per invocation. No full inventory or rescan on each cron run, request or added item; work incrementally and cache derived data at write time.

Logging, as in the sibling repos: logs at sampling 1 with invocation logs, traces at 0.01, query strings redacted, Workers Issues on. Keep volume down in the code: log errors and warnings, plus at most a line or two per run. Handled errors reach Issues only through `console.error`.

## Docker image

- `Dockerfile` (build from the repo root: `docker build -t dumpen .`), `docker-compose.yml`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `docker/` (`README.md` is the Docker Hub page, `entrypoint.sh`, `import-settings.sh`, the container wrangler config).
- The Worker runs in workerd through `wrangler dev --local` with all state under `/data`. The entrypoint renders the source with `tools/render.mjs` from the container environment with zero-setup defaults, and generates missing encryption keys once into `/data`. Images start empty and never read from anyone's Cloudflare resources.
- Settings come from `docker-compose.yml`, or once from `/data/import.env`: `import-settings.sh` merges it into `/data/settings.env` and deletes it. Non-empty compose variables win.
- Keep `docker/README.md` in step with `docker-compose.yml` and `CHANGELOG.md`. Versions are semver. To release, bump the version (package.json or version.txt) on `dev` by semver (major for breaking changes, minor for new features, patch for fixes) and add a `## X.Y.Z – YYYY-MM-DD` entry to CHANGELOG.md. When that reaches `main`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` creates the tag and the GitHub release and calls `docker.yml`, which pushes `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `X` and `latest` to Docker Hub. A merge without a version bump releases nothing. If the Docker job fails, "Re-run failed jobs" on the release run retries it; if the release step stopped after the tag was created, run `docker.yml` by hand (workflow_dispatch on the tag).

## Branches and review

The repo is public on GitHub (`VineDrinker/dumpen`).

- All work happens on `dev`. `main` changes only through a pull request from `dev`, merged with a merge commit (no squash or rebase). Nobody pushes directly to `main`.
- Before starting new work, bring `dev` up to date: `git pull --ff-only origin main`, then push `dev`. `main` requires branches to be up to date, and after each merge the merge commit exists only on `main`.
- Before pushing to `dev`, run the tests and the local review once per finished change set: `cr review --uncommitted --agent -c ../coderabbit/.coderabbit.yaml` (or `--committed`). The shared rules live in `VineDrinker/coderabbit`, cloned next to this repo; a review takes 2–15 minutes.
- Open the PR with `gh pr create --base main --head dev --assignee VineDrinker` and turn on auto-merge with `gh pr merge <number> --auto --merge`. GitHub merges it by itself once the rules on `main` are met: tests, the Docker build, dependency review and CodeQL green, no approval needed. The local CodeRabbit review before pushing is the code review; the CodeRabbit app does not review repos with fewer than ten stars.
- When CI, Docker or Release fails, `.github/workflows/larm.yml` opens an issue labelled `ci-failure` assigned to the owner (or comments on the open one) and closes it when the workflow passes again. Nobody needs to watch GitHub.
- Review findings are input, not a to-do list: a fault gets a fix, a finding that shows the design went wrong gets a rethink or a rewrite, noise is dismissed with a reason. Never use CI or review rounds as a debugging loop.
- Dependency updates arrive as Dependabot PRs. Workflows use only GitHub's own actions, pinned by commit SHA, with a read-only token, and never `pull_request_target`. Nothing may be enabled that can cost money.
